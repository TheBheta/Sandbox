      first|
   2. Projects progress quickly until they become 90 percent
      complete, then they remain at 90 percent complete forever|

      you avoid the embarrassment of estimating the corresponding
      costs|

      things just can't get any worse, they will. When things
      appear to be going better you have overlooked something|
   5. If project content is allowed to change freely, the rate of
      change will exceed the rate of progress|

"...well over half of the time you spend working on a project
 (on the order of 70 percent) is spent thinking, and no tool,
 no matter how advanced, can think for you. Consequently, even
 if a tool did everything except the thinking for you  wrote 100 percent of the code, wrote 100 percent of the
 documentation, did 100 percent of the testing, burned the CD-ROMs,
 put them in boxes, and mailed them to your customers  you could hope for would be a 30 percent improvement in
 productivity. In order to do better than that, you have to change
 the way you think."

"A most important, but also most elusive, aspect of any tool is
 its influence on the habits of those who train themselves in its
 use. If the tool is a programming language this influence is,
 whether we like it or not, an influence on our thinking habits."
 |
"It is practically impossible to teach good programming style to
 students that have had prior exposure to Basic; as potential
 programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of
 regeneration." |
"Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability" |
"The competent programmer is fully aware of the strictly limited
 size of his own skull; therefore he approaches the programming
 task in full humility, and among other things he avoids clever
 tricks like the plague." |
"Any code of your own that you haven't looked at for six or more
 months might as well have been written by someone else."
 |
"Do not worry about your difficulties in mathematics. I can assure
 you that mine are still greater." |
"Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler."
 |
"Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm
 not sure about the universe." |
"I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is
 indispensable." |
"A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by
 little statesmen and philosophers and divines."
 |
"For a sucessful technology, honesty must take precedence over
 public relations for nature cannot be fooled." |
"The first principle is that you must not fool yourself - and you
 are the easiest person to fool." |
"The inside of a computer is as dumb as hell but it goes like
 mad!" |
"You can know the name of a bird in all the languages of the
 world, but when you're finished, you'll know absolutely nothing
 whatever about the bird... So let's look at the bird and see
 what it's doing  the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing
 something." |
"One of the main causes of the fall of the Roman Empire was that,
 lacking zero, they had no way to indicate successful termination
 of their C programs." |
"There is not now, nor has there ever been, nor will there ever be,
 any programming language in which it is the least bit difficult to
 write bad code." |
"Comparing to another activity is useful if it helps you formulate
 questions, it's dangerous when you use it to justify answers."
 |
"Simplicity carried to the extreme becomes elegance."
 |
"If you want a girlfriend, avoid working in the computer games
 industry like the plague. If you work seven days a week, 15
 hours a day for almost two years, with barely enough time for
 a pint, you have no time whatsoever for relationships. Plus
 computer-games makers are regarded as being about as hip and
 cool as abattoir workers." |
"Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring
 aircraft building progress by weight." |
"Good programmers use their brains, but good guidelines save us
 having to think out every case." |

 grow until memory is completely filled." |
"An API that isn't comprehensible isn't usable." |
"How the teacher reacts when something goes wrong tells the class
 what's important." |
"Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained
 by stupidity." |
"The road to wisdom?"
 Well its plain and simple to express:
 Err and err and err again,
 but less and less and less." |
"Moving parts in rubbing contact require lubrication to avoid
 excessive wear. Honorifics and formal politeness provide the
 lubrication where people rub together. Often the very young,
 the untraveled, the naive, the unsophisticated deplore these
 formalities as "empty," "meaningless," or "dishonest," and
 scorn to use them. No matter how "pure" their motives, they
 thereby throw sand into machinery that does not work too well
 at best." |
"There are perhaps 5% of the population that simply *can't* think|
 There are another 5% who *can*, and *do*|
 The remaining 90% *can* think, but *don't*." |
"The open secrets of good design practice include the importance
 of knowing what to keep whole, what to combine, what to separate,
 and what to throw away." |
"We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth.... For my
 part, I am willing to know the whole truth; to know the worst;
 and to provide for it." |
"There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way
 is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies|
 And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no
 obvious deficiencies." |
"The unavoidable price of reliability is simplicity."
 |
"The ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so
 that the necessary may speak." |

 account Hofstadter's Law." |

 Rule 1: Don't do it|
 Rule 2 (for experts only): Don't do it yet."
 |
"Before software can be reusable it first has to be usable."
 |
"First, solve the problem. Then, write the code." |
"It's so easy to become mesmerized by the immediacy of a result
 that you don't question its validity." |
"Most software today is very much like an Egyptian pyramid with
 millions of bricks piled on top of each other, with no
 structural integrity, but just done by brute force and thousands
 of slaves." |
"Perl is another example of filling a tiny, short-term need, and
 then being a real problem in the longer term." |
"We are faced with an insurmountable opportunity." |
"As we said in the preface to the first edition, C 'wears well
 as one's experience with it grows.' With a decade more
 experience, we still feel that way."
 |
"Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first
 place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as
 possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it."
 |
"Trying to outsmart a compiler defeats much of the purpose of
 using one."
 |
"A charlatan makes obscure what is clear; a thinker makes clear
 what is obscure." |
"... the designer of a new system must not only be the implementor
 and the first large-scale user; the designer should also write
 the first user manual. ... If I had not participated fully in
 all these activities, literally hundreds of improvements would
 never have been made, because I would never have thought of
 them or perceived why they were important." |
"Any inaccuracies in this index may be explained by the fact
 that it has been sorted with the help of a computer."
 |
"Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct,
 not tried it." |
"Computers are good at following instructions, but not at reading
 your mind." |
"Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of
 programs. Instead of imagining that our main task is to
 instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on
 explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do."
 |
"TeX has found at least one bug in every Pascal compiler it's
 been run on, I think, and at least two in every C compiler."
 |
"The process of preparing programs for a digital computer is
 especially attractive, not only because it can be economically
 and scientifically rewarding, but also because it can be an
 aesthetic experience much like composing poetry or music."
 |
"These machines have no common sense; they have not yet learned
 to 'think', and they do exactly as they are told, no more and
 no less. This fact is the hardest concept to grasp when one
 first tries to use a computer." |
"You're bound to be unhappy if you optimize everything."
 |
"Programming can be fun, so can cryptography; however they
 should not be combined." |
"The perfect project plan is possible if one first documents a
 list of all the unknowns." |
"Without stress nothing would move." |
"But in our enthusiasm, we could not resist a radical overhaul
 of the system, in which all of its major weaknesses have been
 exposed, analyzed, and replaced with new weaknesses."
 |
"There is nothing more difficult to carry out, nor more doubtful
 of success, nor more dangerous to handle, than to initiate a
 new order of things. For the reformer has enemies in all those
 who profit by the old order, and only lukewarm defenders in all
 those who would profit by the new..."
 |
"If you want a product with certain characteristics, you must
 ensure that the team has those characteristics before the
 product's development."
 |
"You can't have great software without a great team, and most
 software teams behave like dysfunctional families." |
"Good code is its own best documentation. As you're about to add
 a comment, ask yourself, 'How can I improve the code so that
 this comment isn't needed?' Improve the code and then document
 it to make it even clearer." |
"It's hard enough to find an error in your code when you're
 looking for it; it's even harder when you've assumed your code
 is error-free." |
"Testing by itself does not improve software quality. Test
 results are an indicator of quality, but in and of themselves,
 they don't improve it. Trying to improve software quality by
 increasing the amount of testing is like trying to lose weight
 by weighing yourself more often. What you eat before you step
 onto the scale determines how much you will weigh, and the
 software development techniques you use determine how many
 errors testing will find. If you want to lose weight, don't
 buy a new scale; change your diet. If you want to improve your
 software, don't test more; develop better."
 |
"Incompetents invariably make trouble for people other than

"For every complex problem there is an answer that is clear,
 simple, and wrong." |
"Haste is of the devil. Slowness is of God." |
"Say what you will about the Ten Commandments, you must always
 come back to the pleasant fact that there are only ten of them."

"Correctness is clearly the prime quality. If a system does not
 do what it is supposed to do, then everything else about it
 matters little." |
"Incorrect documentation is often worse than no documentation."
 |
"A non-virtual function says, you have to do this and you must
 do it this way. A virtual function says you have to do this,
 but you don't have to do it this way. That's their fundamental
 difference." |
"Debugging a Direct3D application can be challenging."
 |
"Unformed people delight in the gaudy and in novelty. Cooked
 people delight in the ordinary." |
"Any fool can use a computer. Many do." |
"Anyone who considers arithmetical methods of producing random
 numbers is, of course, in a state of sin." |
"There's no sense being exact about something if you don't even
 know what you're talking about." |
"That's the thing about people who think they hate computers|
 What they really hate is lousy programmers."
 |
"The truth does not change according to our ability to stomach
 it." |
"Elegance is not optional" |
"The best performance improvement is the transition from the
 nonworking state to the working state" |
"Complexity kills. It sucks the life out of developers, it makes
 products difficult to plan, build and test, it introduces
 security challenges and it causes end-user and administrator
 frustration." |
"Good code is short, simple, and symmetrical - the challenge
 is figuring out how to get there." |
"Alas, to wear the mantle of Galileo it is not enough that you
 be persecuted by an unkind establishment, you must also be
 right." |
"Copy and paste is a design error" |
"Every program has (at least) two purposes: the one for which
 it was written, and another for which it wasn't."
 |
"There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third
 works." |
"When someone says, 'I want a programming language in which I
 need only say what I want done', give him a lollipop."
 |
"Some problems are so complex that you have to be highly
 intelligent and well informed just to be undecided about them."
 |
"The most amazing achievement of the computer software industry
 is its continuing cancellation of the steady and staggering
 gains made by the computer hardware industry." |
"Computers are useless. They can only give you answers."
 |
"Technology is dominated by two types of people: Those who
 understand what they do not manage. Those who manage what they
 do not understand." |
"Ugly programs are like ugly suspension bridges: they're much
 more liable to collapse than pretty ones, because the way humans
 (especially engineer-humans) perceive beauty is intimately
 related to our ability to process and understand complexity|
 A language that makes it hard to write elegant code makes it
 hard to write good code." |
"PHP is a minor evil perpetrated and created by incompetent
 amateurs, whereas Perl is a great and insidious evil, perpetrated
 by skilled but perverted professionals." |
"UNIX is simple. It just takes a genius to understand its
 simplicity." |
"We only acknowledge small faults in order to make it appear
 that we are free from great ones." |
"Even if you're on the right track, you'll get run over if you
 just sit there." |
"The trouble with the world is that the stupid are cocksure and
 the intelligent are full of doubt." |
"A mathematician is a machine for turning coffee into theorems."

"If the code and the comments disagree, then both are probably
 wrong." |
"It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his
 salary depends on his not understanding it." |
"When you start off by telling those who disagree with you that
 they are not merely in error but in sin, how much of a dialogue
 do you expect ?"" |
"If you lie to the compiler, it will get its revenge."
 |
"Without requirements or design, programming is the art of
 adding bugs to an empty text file." |
"The primary duty of an exception handler is to get the error
 out of the lap of the programmer and into the surprised face of
 the user. Provided you keep this cardinal rule in mind, you
 can't go far wrong." |
"We are tied down to a language which makes up in obscurity what
 it lacks in style." |
"A notation is important for what it leaves out."
 |
"An organisation that treats its programmers as morons will soon
 have programmers that are willing and able to act like morons
 only." |
"I did say something along the lines of 'C makes it easy to
 shoot yourself in the foot; C++ makes it harder, but when you
 do, it blows your whole leg off.'" |
"I have always wished that my computer would be as easy to use
 as my telephone. My wish has come true. I no longer know how
 to use my telephone." |
"The most important single aspect of software development is to
 be clear about what you are trying to build."
 |
"To many managers, getting rid of the arrogant, undisciplined,
 over-paid, technology-obsessed, improperly-dressed etc|
 programmers would appear to be a significant added benefit."
     section 24.2.4
|
"Exceptions relieve the programmer of tedious writing
 boilerplate code  code  that error handling code is more separate from the main program
 logic."
 |
"A multithreaded file system is only a performance hack."

"The best is the enemy of the good." |
"Most of you are familiar with the virtues of a programmer|
 There are three, of course: laziness, impatience, and hubris."
 |
"We all agree on the necessity of compromise. We just can't
 agree on when it's necessary to compromise." |
"Power is the ability to control things, moral authority is the
 ability to change things" |
"When one is postulating correlations or causations extant in
 reality, one should always remember that the human brain is
 mainly a pattern recognition engine. And it is such a
 persistent pattern recognition engine that it often perceives
 patterns where none exist." |
"The pessimist complains about the wind; the optimist expects it
 to change; the realist adjusts the sails."
 |
"They always say time changes things, but you actually have to
 change them yourself." |
"If builders built buildings the way programmers wrote programs,
 then the first woodpecker that came along would destroy
 civilisation." |
"Naturally we feel that mentally ill people are not what we are
 looking for when we hire programmers - although there is no
 empirical data to support or contradict that view... Is it
 appropriate to give tests for mental illness to anyone applying
 for any kind of job?"
 |
"As soon as we started programming, we found to our surprise
 that it wasn't as easy to get programs right as we had thought|
 Debugging had to be discovered. I can remember the exact
 instant when I realized that a large part of my life from then
 on was going to be spent in finding mistakes in my own
 programs." |
"Increasingly, people seem to misinterpret complexity as
 sophistication, which is baffling - the incomprehensible should
 cause suspicion rather than admiration. Possibly this trend
 results from a mistaken belief that using a somewhat mysterious
 device confers an aura of power on the user." |
"More computing sins are committed in the name of efficiency
 (without necessarily achieving it) than for any other single
 reason - including blind stupidity." |
"If you think your management doesn't know what it's doing or
 that your organisation turns out low-quality software crap that
 embarrasses you, then leave."

"The purpose of software engineering is to control complexity,
 not to create it." |

"A computer lets you make more mistakes faster than any invention
 in human history - with the possible exceptions of handguns and
 tequila." |
"The best thing about a boolean is even if you are wrong, you
 are only off by a bit."
|
"Mr. Madison, what you've just said is one of the most insanely
 idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling,
 incoherent response were you even close to anything that could
 be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now
 dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and
 may God have mercy on your soul." |
"There are, it has been said, two types of people in the world|
 There are those who, when presented with a glass that is exactly
 half full, say: this glass is half full. And then there are
 those who say: this glass is half empty. The world belongs,
 however, to those who can look at the glass and say: What's up
 with this glass? Excuse me? Excuse me? This is my glass? I don't
 think so. My glass was full! And it was a bigger glass!"
 |
'What our ancestors would really be thinking, if they were alive
 today, is: "Why is it so dark in here?"'

"The trouble with having an open mind, of course, is that people
 will insist on coming along and trying to put things in it."
 |
'That seems to point up a significant difference between Europeans
 and Americans. A European says: "I can't understand this,
 what's wrong with me?" An American says: "I can't understand
 this, what's wrong with him?"' |
"Some humans would do anything to see if it was possible to do it|
 If you put a large switch in some cave somewhere, with a sign on
 it saying 'End-of-the-World Switch. PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH', the
 paint wouldn't even have time to dry."

 whatsoever,' he said. 'Have you thought of going into
 teaching?"

"I'd rather be a climbing ape than a falling angel."
 |
"DON'T THINK OF IT AS DYING, said Death. JUST THINK OF IT AS
 LEAVING EARLY TO AVOID THE RUSH."

"There is a rumour going around that I have found God. I think
 this is unlikely because I have enough difficulty finding my
 keys, and there is empirical evidence that they exist."

"Many people, meeting Aziraphale for the first time, formed three

 glass? Excuse me? Excuse me? This is my glass? I don't think so|
 My glass was full! And it was a bigger glass! Who's been pinching
 my beer?
 And at the other end of the bar the world is full of the other
 type of person, who has a broken glass, or a glass that has been
 carelessly knocked over (usually by one of the people calling
 for a larger glass) or who had no glass at all, because he was
 at the back of the crowd and had failed to catch the barman's
 eye. "

  Elves are fantastic. They create fantasies|
  Elves are glamorous. They project glamour|
  Elves are enchanting. They weave enchantment|
  Elves are terrific. They beget terror|
  The thing about words is that meanings can twist just like a

"Getting an education was a bit like a communicable sexual
 disease. It made you unsuitable for a lot of jobs and then you
 had the urge to pass it on."

"He'd noticed that sex bore some resemblance to cookery: it
 fascinated people, they sometimes bought books full of
 complicated recipes and interesting pictures, and sometimes when
 they were really hungry they created vast banquets in their
 imagination - but at the end of the day they'd settle quite
 happily for egg and chips. If it was well done and maybe had a
 slice of tomato."
 |
"The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was
 because they managed to spend less money|

 Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month
 plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty
 dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK
 for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard
 gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots
 Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that
 he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by
 the feel of the cobbles|

 But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A
 man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd
 still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor
 man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred
 dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet|

 This was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic
 unfairness."

"Everything starts somewhere, though many physicists disagree|
 But people have always been dimly aware of the problem with the

 the truth is Hitler did very little. He was a world class
 asshole, but the evil actually done, from the death camps to
 World War Two, was all done by citizens who were afraid to
 question if what they were told by their government was the
 truth or not, and who because they did not want to admit to
 themselves that they were afraid to question the government,
 refused to see the truth behind the Reichstag Fire, refused to
 see the invasion by Poland was a staged fake, and followed
 Hitler into national disaster."

 the fundamental difference between our worlds, with respect to
 propaganda, is quite simple. You tend to believe yours and we
 tend to disbelieve ours."

 is seeking to understand violence does not belong to any
 country, to any religion, to any political party or partial
 system; he is concerned with the total understanding of
 mankind."

 slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best he
 can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece?
 Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia,
 nor in England, nor for that matter in Germany. That is
 understood. But after all, it is the leaders of the country who
 determine the policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag
 the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist
 dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship..|
 Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the
 bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is to
 tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists
 for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger."
